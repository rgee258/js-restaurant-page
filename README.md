# JS Restaurant Page

In this repository you'll find a fake restaurant page created primarily with JavaScript.

This page was created to practice using NPM and Webpack, along with Javascript modules. The production code presented in this page was bundled using Webpack, which was installed using NPM. All of the tabbed content was imported and exported in their own modules, and used to create a seemingly dynamic usage experience, by manipulating the DOM and removing or adding nodes.

## Latest Additions

Although not specified in the project, I added the following npm packages to prepare the css and images for production:

* css-loader
* style-loader
* file-loader

It was first time using it and I found these helpful to learn how to use these packages:

* Webpack's [Asset Management Guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/)
* Dated but informative [Medium article on CSS with Webpack](https://medium.com/a-beginners-guide-for-webpack-2/webpack-loaders-css-and-sass-2cc0079b5b3a)
* Follow up [article on using the file loader](https://medium.com/a-beginners-guide-for-webpack-2/file-loader-for-large-size-images-97b90249aef)
