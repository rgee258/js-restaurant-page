# JS Restaurant Page

In this repository you'll find a fake restaurant page created primarily with JavaScript.

This page was created to practice using NPM and Webpack, along with Javascript modules. The production code presented in this page was bundled using Webpack, which was installed using NPM. All of the tabbed content was imported and exported in their own modules, and used to create a seemingly dynamic usage experience, by manipulating the DOM and removing or adding nodes.

GitHub Pages doesn't seem to be complying to display the page correctly, so none this time.

This project is done following The Odin Project, which can
